## EVENTS VENUES

[Base Layer](https://en.baselayer.asia/)&nbsp;this company has a relatively small, intimate space near Harajuku / Meiji-jingumae&nbsp; / Kita-sando and is one of my favorites; [Ethereum Japan](https://ethereum-japan.jp) often have high quality events there, they also arrange events at, for example WeWork.

[FinGATE Kayaba](https://www.spacemarket.com/spaces/fingate)&nbsp;- it’s a fairly large space available to rent, a bit soulless and not so convenient, but with large capacity, in Kayabacho which used to be Tokyo’s financial center and where the Tokyo Stock Exchange still is.

[nagatacho GRID](https://grid.tokyo.jp) - funky, industrial co-working facility with a couple of spaces for rent, 6F best for presentations and a more intimate B1 bar type space, near Akasaka Mitsuke, Nagatacho and Kojimachi.

[FABcafe](https://fabcafe.com/tokyo/) - smaller space, has a lot of 3D printers for creatives, in Shibuya, intimate presentation area with screen and bar.

[Forum 8](https://www.forum-8.co.jp) also in Shibuya, a bit of an old building and dingy spaces, but cheap and cheerful I guess and different capacity rooms.

[Neutrino](https://www.neutrino.global/tokyo) - interesting [OmiseGO](https://omisego.network) project for co-working at which some interesting events (e.g. [Dfinity](https://dfinity.org/)) have also been held, funky, industrial vibe.

[WeWork](https://www.wework.com/l/tokyo) (multiple inc. Ginza 6, Meiji-jingumae) obviously upmarket venue, Ginza 6 better than Meiji-jingumae for events I think.

[Fabbit](https://fabbit.co.jp) - [TeamZ](https://www.teamz.co.jp) often use the Otemachi/Tokyo station branch for their blockchain events, stylish modern venue and co-working space.

[ninetytwo13](https://tokyochapter.com)&nbsp;- Cool retro design, co-working, living and events space on the boundary of Roppongi and Akasaka.

[Blink](https://blinkcommunity.com)&nbsp;- another co-working and events space with a developer/techie slant, in Azabu, near Roppongi.

[Impact Hub](https://en.hubtokyo.com/) in Meguro is another co-working and space rental venue, again with a techie slant. Home of [Tokyo Fintech](https://medium.com/tokyo-fintech/top-tokyo-crypto-meetups-7aa921c0fbc1) (see below).

[Bitcoin Center Japan](http://bitcoincenterjapan.org/) opened in 2017, near Hanzomon station.

[Hashhub](https://www.hashhub.tokyo/en) - co-working and events space, near Hongo-san-chome station

[EDGEOf](https://edgeof.co/space/) - funky, industrial, clubby space in heart of Shibuya; [Cryptokitties](https://www.neweconomy.jp/series/cryptoage/22774) had their Tokyo launch there

## EVENTS LISTINGS

I list up ALL the events I know of [here](https://www.tokyobitcoiner.com/search/events)&nbsp;on a monthly basis - it’s a great resource if you are in town and want to meet people in the crypto/blockchain/fintech space!

Norbert of [Tokyo Fintech](https://medium.com/tokyo-fintech/top-tokyo-crypto-meetups-7aa921c0fbc1) lists bigger events over a longer timeframe too.

[Most of these are&nbsp;[Meet Up](https://www.meetup.com/find/events/?allMeetups=false&amp;keywords=tokyo&amp;radius=5&amp;userFreeform=Tokyo%2C+Japan&amp;mcId=z1023444&amp;mcName=Tokyo%2C+JP&amp;eventFilter=mysugg)&nbsp;and&nbsp;[Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/d/japan--tokyo/events/?loc=tokyo&amp;lc=1)&nbsp;and there’s also&nbsp;[Peatix](https://peatix.com/search?country=JP&amp;l.ll=35.6894875%2C139.69170639999993&amp;l.text=Tokyo%2C%20Japan&amp;p=1&amp;size=10&amp;v=3.4&amp;dr=)&nbsp;which often lists the Japanese language only events and seems to reach more local Japanese people.]

Another Japanese site has some different events including the Japanese language ones that I don’t usually list, [Rising Bitcoin](http://risingbitcoin.jp/?page_id=37), and also [Tokyo Start Up Events](http://www.tokyostartupevents.com) (it’s in Japanese but you can toggle to English, but many of the events are in Japanese)

(implementation by bitFlyer)

[BIC Camera](https://www.biccamera.com/bc/c/info/payment/bitcoin.jsp)&nbsp;accept bitcoin up to 100,000 yen

[Yamada Labi](http://yamada-taxfree.com/en/featured-concept-labi-tokyo) Shinjuku and the Concept Labi across from Tokyo Station accept bitcoin

## BARS/CLUBS ACCEPTING CRYPTO

[The Two Dogs Taproom](https://www.twodogs-tokyo.com)&nbsp;- it’s often the home to BTC and BCH meet ups, you can pay with either currencies and is in the Roppongi entertainment district.

[Rakan](https://%E3%82%AF%E3%83%A9%E3%83%96%E3%83%8A%E3%83%93.com/kanto/tokyo/rakan-tokyo/), it’s a club/night lounge in Roppongi too, accepting BCH and having held a few BCH events there.

[Mezzo](http://mezzo.tokyo/), luxury bar and lounge, again Roppongi

[The Pink Cow](http://www.thepinkcow.com)&nbsp;- the first retailer to accept bitcoin in&nbsp; 2013 and now a big BCH supporter, in Akasaka, which has quite a few hotels and good connections.

[Good Heavens!](https://www.facebook.com/goodheavensbar)&nbsp;- it’s a British-style pub, with sports screening and a comedy club; the pre-party for Satoshi Vision 2018 was held there. In Shimo-kitazawa which is a pretty cool interesting place; think used/retro clothes and one-off shops, easy access from Shibuya (Inokashira line train).

The biggest evangelists for adoption are the Tokyo BCH gang, check out their&nbsp;[meet ups](https://www.meetup.com/Tokyo-Bitcoin-Cash-Meetup-Group/events/)&nbsp;past and present for restaurants and bars which accept bitcoin cash.

The app [Marco Coino](https://www.coinline.co.nz/marco-coino/) lists BCH accepting merchants worldwide, incidentally.

And there is also [bitcoinmap.cash](https://bitcoinmap.cash)&nbsp;(I like the dark theme) that shows similar.

## OTHER TOURISTY STUFF

Taxis - in my opinion use regular taxis or the train/metro network, UBER is in Tokyo but it is more of an expensive black limousine service, a regular taxi hailed from the street would be faster and cheaper, and the trains are regular and safe, if jam packed at peak times.

Accommodation - [booking.com](https://www.booking.com/s/11_6/jim92365), hotel.com, expedia all have lots of options. AirBNB sadly got kind of regulated out of existence, but there is a kind of crypto one; [Cryptocribs](https://www.cryptocribs.com/s?&amp;address=tokyo&amp;chosen=1)&nbsp;(but I haven’t tried it).

[Trunk Hotel](https://trunk-hotel.com) Shibuya - it’s a cool, boutique hotel, trendy coffee/bar space, even sells its own goods; suitable for Bitcoin OGs or whales.

[Nest Inn Hakone](https://nestinn-h.co.jp/en/)&nbsp;- stylish hot spring hotel as a getaway from Tokyo; post-conference relaxation, or romance.

[Robot Cafe](http://shinjuku-robot.com/pc/index.php?lng=ja) - has a part of bitcoin history [“where Roger met Nic”](https://www.wired.com/2017/05/one-scrappy-startup-survived-early-bitcoin-wars/).

[Streamer Coffee](http://streamer.coffee/) - it’s my favorite coffee shop and a great place to get some work done with fast WiFi and nice industrial chic spaces; the Tokyo Garden Place expresso branch (Akasaka Mitsuke/Nagatacho) near to Yahoo! Japan offices is a relaxed space shared with a Famima upmarket convenience store.

[Guzman y Gomez](http://gyg.jp/en/) - my fave Tex Mex (although it’s Australian!); Harajuku, Shibuya, Shinagawa.

[Mt. Takao](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3029.html) - easy place to get to see some countryside, very light hiking, eat udon, Japanese-y feeling.

[Kamakura WeBase](http://we-base.jp/kamakura/?lang=en) hostel/capsule hotel - budget accommodation that’s actually stylish and clean and good for exploring Kamakura (hire a bike) or beach; more for shrimps than whales; a very Japanese place to stay would be [Zen Vague](https://www.zenvague.com/house/rooms/)

[Enoshima](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3117.html) - another easy day trip, beach, some Japanese culture, could combine with Kamakura; there’s also a capsule hotel there _In Frame_.

[Akihabara](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3003.html) - take your pick: manga, anime, maid cafes, cosplay, trading cards, model kits, character goods, retro-gaming, electronics, used cameras, computers etc. and lots of kebab shops.

[Ghibli museum](http://www.ghibli-museum.jp/en/)&nbsp;- you need advance reservations and you can do this outside Japan. It’s in [Kichijoji](https://www.blockchainhub.co.jp/en/) which is a nice place to stroll around.

[Ueno Science Museum](http://www.kahaku.go.jp/english/)&nbsp;- there’s a Zero fighter, some space exhibits, engineering; also natural history.

[Odaiba Miraikan](http://www.miraikan.jst.go.jp/en/) - it’s the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation; Asimo, humanoid androids, exhibits on the Japanese space program; if you know London, [Odaiba](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3008.html) is a kind of “docklands” with a light driverless railway, there’s the famous [Gundam](https://en.japantravel.com/tokyo/unicorn-gundam-statue-in-odaiba/41317) statue, shopping malls and&nbsp;[Oedo Onsen](http://daiba.ooedoonsen.jp/en/) - an urban hot spring.

[Edo-Tokyo Museum](https://www.edo-tokyo-museum.or.jp/en/) - if you have two hours or so and you’d like to see something Japanese-y (and maybe the weather is bad) this museum has some interesting exhibits and reconstructions + it’s near the sumo stadium and [Tokyo Skytree](https://medium.com/tokyo-fintech/top-tokyo-crypto-meetups-7aa921c0fbc1) direction.
